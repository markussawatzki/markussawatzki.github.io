Passionate about programming languages, philosophy, computer science, and particularly IT security, I aspire to share my knowledge and expertise while facing new challenges to improve and learn from new experiences. 

Regarding IT Security, my journey began at the University of Paderborn in Germany.
During my student years, I had the privilege of being a part of the <a href="https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/en/syssec">System Security group</a> at the University of Paderborn, led by TLS expert Prof. Dr.-Ing. Juraj Somorovsky. I contributed to the group as a tutor for the bachelor's degree course "IT Security".

During my studies, I started exploring the field of ethical hacking.
For instance, I successfully tackled Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges in several categories, particularly in binary exploitation, applied cryptography, and web. Additionally, I was selected as one of the 23 finalists in the competitive CTF event "<a href="https://deutschlands-bester-hacker.de/">Germany's Best Hacker 2022,</a>" among 1300 registered participants.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, earning an overall grade of 1.8 in the German grading system. For my bachelor thesis, I conducted a comprehensive security analysis of a pacemaker programmer, applying my knowledge in reverse engineering and penetration testing.

My foundation in IT security was solidified during my one-year position as a student assistant in the medical engineering department at St. Vincenz Hospital in Paderborn. My responsibilities included thorough risk analyses for both network infrastructure and medical devices. Under the supervision of Dr. Markus Willing, my superior and the head of the department with an academic background in IT security, I gained more expertise by facing and solving upcoming challenges on the spot. This included conducting penetration tests on medical devices and web interfaces, ensuring the resilience of critical healthcare systems against potential malicious attacks.

Aside from IT Security, I'm passionate about programming and have been for the past decade, starting with Java when I was still in school. Since then, I've honed my skills for multiple languages like Java, C, C++, Python, JavaScript, and Bash. Having mastered these diverse languages,  I can quickly adapt to new ones as well as novel tools and environments.

In 2018, I started an open-source project together with a colleague with the aim of improving the YouTube user experience.
Especially nowadays, the YouTube algorithm keeps promoting videos, channels and comments that are of no interest to the user and are distracting.
As the available solutions at that time offered only limited improvements, we decided to develop our own.
Overcoming challenges presented by web extension APIs, cross-browser compatibility, changes caused by new deployments of YouTube, a unique debugging and testing environment, and the final publishing process that includes a review of every publishing party, we released the "<a href="https://github.com/Time-Machine-Development/Channel-Blocker">Channel Blocker</a>" web extension.
Highlighting the positive impact of our efforts, the extension is currently used by over <a href='https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/channel-blocker/nfkmalbckemmklibjddenhnofgnfcdfp'>100,000 people on Chrome</a> alone.
I am proud to have contributed to their enhanced experience on YouTube, enabling them to block channels, videos and comments using their individually defined blacklists and regular expressions.

Guided by the work ethics represented in my projects, I aspire to make a positive and lasting impact in the field of IT security.
